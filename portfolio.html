            <h2>Group Mid-Powered Rocket Project (GMPR)
                Engineering 1RK, University of California, Los Angeles</h2>
            <p class="p">
                As part of a team of three, I led the design, construction, and testing
                of a G-class rocket that successfully reached a target apogee of 3,000 feet.
                The project involved designing and integrating payload systems to safely carry a raw
                egg and an Adalogger sensor package, ensuring protection and successful recovery. Using
                SolidWorks for CAD modeling
                and OpenRocket for flight simulations, I optimized the rocket's stability, thrust, and overall
                performance. The manufacturing
                process included creating components with fiberglass layups, laser cutting, and 3D printing,
                achieving precise tolerances and
                durable construction. I also delivered a comprehensive Flight Read

            <h2>Mars Rover Project, UCLA HAcK Competition, Summer 2024</h2>
            <p class="p">
                Participated in a 48-hour challenge to design and build a functional Mars rover
                prototype. As the CAD lead, I utilized SolidWorks to design a robust and lightweight rover
                chassis tailored
                to house critical components, including a temperature/humidity sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and
                camera. I also spearheaded
                the development of the claw and arm mechanisms, iterating designs for optimal precision,
                reliability, and payload retrieval
                efficiency. These models enabled seamless manufacturing, where I applied hands-on skills to
                bring the designs to life. Judges
                awarded our team honorable mention for outstanding manufacturing craftsmanship, recognizing my
                attention to detail and technical
                contributions. This experience deepened my expertise in CAD modeling, rapid prototyping, and
                design iteration under time constraints.

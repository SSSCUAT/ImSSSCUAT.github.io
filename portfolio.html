        <p class="p">I am a dedicated advocate for STEM education
            with a strong commitment to fostering inclusive
            and supportive learning environments. My academic
            journey has been shaped by overcoming challenges,
            which has fueled my passion for inspiring others to achieve
            their goals. I believe in the power of community and
            collaboration in education, and I strive to create opportunities
            for individuals to explore their interests and succeed in their
            pursuits. Through my experiences, I have developed a deep
            appreciation for the transformative impact of education
            and am committed to empowering others in their learning journeys.</p>
